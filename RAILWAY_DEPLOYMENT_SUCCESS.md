## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & NEXT STEPS

### 1. Google Credentials Setup Required
```
⚠️  Warning: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON environment variable not set
```
**Action Needed**: Add `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` environment variable in Railway dashboard with full JSON content from `credentials.json`.

### 2. WhatsApp Authentication Required
```
🔐 First time setup - WhatsApp authentication required
📱 Please check Railway logs for QR code or authentication status
```
**Action Needed**: Check Railway logs for QR code to authenticate WhatsApp Web connection.

### 3. Bridge Connection Status
```
⏳ Waiting for bridge to respond... (1/10 through 10/10)
```
**Status**: Bridge started but needs WhatsApp authentication to become fully operational.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1: Complete Google Sheets Integration
1. **Add Google Credentials**:
   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard, add variable:
   GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"sheets-api-473708"...}
   ```

2. **Verify Google Sheets Access**:
   - Sheet ID: `1TYxDLyCqDHr0Imb5j7X4uJhxccgJTO0KrDVAD0Ja0Dk`
   - Ensure service account has edit permissions

### Priority 2: Authenticate WhatsApp
1. **Check Railway Logs** for QR code or authentication prompts
2. **Scan QR Code** with WhatsApp mobile app if displayed
3. **Verify Connection** - logs should show "Connected to WhatsApp"

### Priority 3: Test Complete Workflow  
1. **Post Test Drop**: Send "DR00000099" in Velo Test WhatsApp group
2. **Verify Detection**: Check Railway logs for drop detection
3. **Check Google Sheets**: Confirm drop appears in spreadsheet
4. **Test QA Feedback**: Verify incomplete feedback messages

## 🔍 MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### Railway Dashboard Monitoring
- **Deployment Logs**: Monitor service startup and errors
- **Metrics**: Track CPU, memory, and request patterns
- **Variables**: Manage environment configuration
- **Deployments**: View deployment history and rollback if needed

### Log Monitoring Commands (for future local debugging)
```bash
# View Railway logs (from Railway dashboard)
# Or check local development logs:
tail -f /app/logs/whatsapp-bridge.log
tail -f /app/logs/drop-monitor.log  
tail -f /app/logs/qa-feedback.log
```

### Health Check Status
- **Railway Health Check**: Disabled (services start without health dependency)
- **Service Monitoring**: Built-in process monitoring and auto-restart
- **Manual Health Check**: Services can be monitored via Railway dashboard

---

## 💡 SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Worked Well
1. **Pre-built Binary Approach**: Avoided Go version conflicts
2. **Multi-stage Docker**: Clean, efficient container build
3. **Service Orchestration**: Proper startup order and dependencies
4. **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management
5. **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployments on code changes

### Lessons Learned
1. **Health Checks**: Simple services don't need complex health endpoints
2. **Dependencies**: Pre-built binaries solve version compatibility issues
3. **Security**: Never commit credentials - use environment variables
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in Railway monitoring sufficient for basic services
